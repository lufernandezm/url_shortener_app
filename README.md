# URL Shortener Application

Welcome to the URL Shortener Application! This project is designed to create a simple web application that serves as a URL shortener. Users can submit a long URL and receive a shortened version that redirects to the original URL when accessed.

## Getting Started
This application is divided into two main parts: the Backend and the Frontend. To get the application running, you'll need to set up both parts. Please refer to the specific README files for detailed setup instructions.

### Backend Setup
The backend application is built with FastAPI and Python. Before proceeding, ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.

Refer to the [Url Shortener Backend README](./url_shortener_backend/README.md) for detailed instructions on setting up the development environment, including creating a virtual environment, activating it, and installing dependencies.

### Frontend Setup
The frontend application is built with React and Node.js. Make sure you have NodeJs installed on your machine before starting.

For detailed setup instructions, including how to run the application in development mode, refer to the [Url Shortener Frontend README](./url_shortener_frontend/README.md).
